Video 1 Part 1 - The Psychology of Instant Influence

Hello, hello, hello. Can everyone see my screen? Can everyone hear me? All right. Please give me a yes in the chat box just so I know that you guys can see and hear everything loud and clear.

OK, yes, yes, yes, I'm seeing a few yeses. Perfect. I'm really happy that you're here today because I hope.

And I hope you're just as excited as I am, because we're going to cover a lot of groundbreaking stuff in this call. And it has a lot of profit potential. OK, so I think everyone can see my screen.

So let's get this ball rolling. Welcome to the DM copy system. Get comfortable, because over the next four weeks, we're going to go in a very exciting journey together.

We're going to deep dive into the art and science of crafting tiny, powerful messages that make a huge impact. We'll be talking about direct messages, DMs and how to make them your secret weapon for connection and conversion. And we've got a lot of ground to cover.

So let's get started by building a solid foundation on this call. In today's session, we're going to cover the psychology of instant influence, also known as emotional hooks 101. So why are we focusing on microcopy? What makes this short, sharp messages so special? Well, think about your own experience online.

We're absolutely bombarded with information, aren't we? Every time we go online, there's a million things fighting for your attention. Everyone's trying to get you to check something out, visit some website, buy some product. And because of that, our attention spans are shrinking.

Some studies even say that they're shorter than a goldfish. We'll talk about that more really soon. And in this noisy digital world, the ability to communicate your message quickly, clearly and persuasively in a few words is no longer nice to have.

It's a superpower that you have. Microcopy the tiny bits of text in DMs, social media posts, headlines and calls to action is your tool to cut through that noise. More importantly, DMs offer a direct and personal line to your audience.

It's where the real conversations are happening right now and where you can build a genuine relationship with your audience, and this is priceless in today's market. Now. For the big promise of the DM copy system and specifically what we're aiming for, by the end of our time together and with practice, you will learn how to become dangerously persuasive in 160 characters or less.

Yeah, you heard that right. Think Twitter length, SMS length, the kind of message that fits into the DM preview when you watch the preview screen on your phone. Of course, sometimes you'll use a few more characters than that.

But the principle about. Maximum impact with minimum words remains, I'm going to equip you with the strategies and the psychological triggers to make your short messages incredibly compelling, so they grab attention, spark curiosity and drive action. Imagine being able to craft short texts and DMs that people not only open, but actually respond to DMs that build trust, DMs that gently guide prospects towards saying yes to whatever you're offering.

That's the goal. That's your mission. So let's get to it.

All right, let's talk about something that underpins everything we're going to learn. The state of human attention. You've probably heard this statistic before, the one that says that the average human attention span has plummeted to around eight seconds long, supposedly less than that of a goldfish with clocks at nine seconds.

Now, whether that exact statistic is scientifically ironclad is debated by researchers. Some say it's an oversimplification, but let's be honest, it feels true. And that's what matters.

Think about how quickly you scroll on your social media feeds, especially when you're on your phone. How many tabs do you have open right now? How quickly do you click away from a website if it doesn't grab your attention instantly? The reality, we live in the age of information overload. We're constantly being pinged, buzzed and notified of new things.

Our brains have adapted to become incredibly skilled at filtering things out. And this is the same for your audience. If something doesn't immediately signal relevance or value.

Proof. It's gone. It's gone from our awareness.

Think about watching a YouTube video. If the first five or 10 seconds don't hook you, how likely are you to click the back button or just move on to the next video? It's almost an unconscious reflex by now. And it works the same way in business.

This means that your emails, your social media posts, your DMs have a tiny window to make an impression if you're opening line is weak or your message is unclear. You've lost the chance before you even really got started. And this brings us to a crucial concept that I call the thumb stop principle.

Imagine someone scrolling through their Instagram feed, their Facebook timeline or even their list of DMs. Their thumb is moving at lightning speed, flick, flick, flick, flick. What is it that makes you stop that scroll? What breaks through their scanning pattern and makes them pause even for a second or two? Is it a long logical argument, a detailed list of product features? No, probably not, especially in that initial moment of discovery.

The answer overwhelmingly is emotion, something that sparks curiosity, something that makes them laugh, something that makes them resonate with a desire they're having, something that triggers a slight fear of missing out on something, something that makes them feel something, anything other than indifference. Logic and reason have their place. Absolutely.

But people use logic to justify their decisions. But emotion is what captures their initial attention. Emotion is the gatekeeper.

If you can't make an emotional connection in those first few seconds, they'll never stick around long enough for your logic to do its work. Consider this these two DM openers. The first one is purely logical and a bit formal.

It reads, Dear Robert, I'm writing to inform you about a new online software solution that has features X, Y and Z designed to improve your efficiency. The second one, while still professional, attempts to connect on a shared feeling or problem, sparking a little curiosity and empathy. Here's how it reads.

Hey, Robert, quick question. Are you also finding signing up new clients for your fitness coaching a bit overwhelming lately? It's more it's much more likely to get a pause and read. So the first hurdle in any microcopy you write, especially on the ends, is that it needs to be a thumb stopper.

And the key. And the key to that is understanding and leveraging the emotions that your audience is feeling, and that's precisely what we're going to explore in this call today. We've established that emotion is key to stopping the scroll and grabbing attention.

Now let's dig a little bit deeper into why emotions are so powerful and which ones are most effective for persuasion, especially in short text based messages, neuroscience and psychology tell us that emotions are fundamental to our decision making process. Often we make decisions based on an emotional response first and then a rational brain picks in to justify that decision. Antonio Damaso, a renowned neuroscientist, showed on his research that people who had damage to the emotional centers of their brains, even if their logical reasoning was intact, found it almost impossible to make decisions, even simple ones.

Think about it. Why do you buy a particular brand of coffee, for example? Is it purely the price per gram or is it purely the origin of the beans that you're meticulously analyzing? Or is it also about the feeling that it gives you, the comfort, the morning ritual, the aroma that makes you feel awake and ready for the day? That's emotion at play. In marketing and sales, understanding this emotional hierarchy is like having a secret key.

When you can tap into the right emotions, you're not just communicating information, you're connecting with the very core of what makes people tick and what's and what's motivating them to act. So what are these powerful action triggered action triggering emotions? There are many of them, of course, but here are some of the primary ones that are particularly relevant when you're trying to persuade or influence someone, especially with tiny microcopy messages. The first one is fear.

This is a very strong motivator. Fear of loss, fear of missing out, FOMO, fear of making a mistake, fear of pain or negative consequences if you don't do something right. People often do more to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.

So let me give you an example of fear. Oh, here's there's only three spots left. Don't miss your chance to join.

The next emotion is desire, and it's the flip side of fear, the desire to gain the desire to gain pleasure for the desire for achievement, for self-improvement, for a better future. We're all driven by aspirations. So.

Another example of desire would be imagine finally achieving. One hundred percent email open rates in just 30 days. That's desire at play.

The next one is curiosity. Humans are naturally inquisitive. If you can create an information gap or a hint at something novel or surprising, people will want to know more.

That's huge for DMs. Let me give you an example, I just discovered something about Internet marketing that might just surprise you. There, I created an information gap and it's part curiosity in you.

The next emotion is belonging or social proof. We are social creatures. We want to be accepted.

We want to be a part of a group to know that others just like us are doing something testimonials and social proof tap into this emotion. For example, hey, come join one thousand plus other smart marketers who are already using this email marketing method. The next emotion is trust.

People buy from you before people buy from you. They need to trust you. This is about feeling safe, secure and believing in your credibility and your authenticity.

Let me give you an example of a DM with a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee, you have nothing to lose. The next emotion is anger or frustration. I also call this problem agitation.

Sometimes gently highlighting a frustration or a pain point that someone is experiencing can make them more receptive to a solution. For example, tired of wasting hours on a tedious task. There's a much better way.

The next emotion is joy or happiness. Showing people the positive outcome, the happiness, the relief that your product or service can bring is a powerful emotion to tap into, for example, our customers are saying they're feeling great after taking the green tea. Okay.

And the next emotion is surprise. This is also a pattern interrupt, something unexpected that can break through the noise and grab the attention of your reader, for example, an unusual question or a surprising statistic or even a funny graphic can cause a surprise. It's also important to note that we're not talking about manipulating people here.

We're talking about understanding the genuine human emotions that are already there in your audience and connecting your message to those emotions in an authentic way, while all those emotions can be powerful. Some are particularly well suited for quick, snappy text based persuasion, like in DMs or social media updates. For microcopy, these are pure gold.

First, we have curiosity. This is arguably the heavyweight champion of DMs. If you can make someone curious with your first few words, they have to read on.

They have to know the answer. It's like you create a niche that they're going to need to scratch. So, for example, hey, I got a quick question for you about your recent post.

They're going to they're going to need to know what that question is. Or, hey, you'll never guess what I just learned about email marketing. Can I tell it to you? You're creating a lot of curiosity in just a few words.

The next emotion is desire. What does your ideal prospect secretly or not so secretly want? More time? More money? Less stress? More recognition? If your microcopy can tap into that core desire and hint that you may have a way for them to achieve it, you've got their attention. For example, what if you could get a 75 email open rate without rewriting your headline 20 times? OK, the next emotion is the fear of missing out, also called FOMO.

This is a powerful one, especially in a fast moving digital world that we're living in. People hate feeling that they're going to be left behind or missing out on a great opportunity. Now, you need to use this ethically and genuinely.

So let's say, for example, our early bird discount ends tonight, don't miss out on saving 50 percent off your. Coffee order tonight or. Everyone in Internet marketing is talking about this new tool.

You those are the kind of phrases that you used to create the fear of missing out or or tap into the fear of missing out. Because you're not creating it, you're tapping into something that's already there, something that they're already feeling. The next emotion is belonging or social proof, showing that others are already benefiting from what you have to offer or that they can join a community, for example, that makes you that's going to make your offer more attractive and less risky.

It's. It's not the same jumping into something that's brand new than when someone tells you, hey, over 500 small business owners have already transformed their marketing using this system. And last but not least, let's talk about urgency.

Why should they act right now rather than later? A little bit of urgency can prompt action, but again, it must be genuine. So, for example, there's only 20 spots available for our free workshop next week. Want to join? Mastering how you weave these five emotions into your short messages will dramatically increase your engagement and your response rates will be looking.

We're going to be looking at specific frameworks for for these emotions very soon. So. We know which emotions are powerful, but how does this actually work in the brain when someone reads your tiny text message? Well, it's all about achieving what I call an emotional click.

Think of it as a tiny spark, your micro message is that spark. If it's created correctly, it lands in the reader's mind and ignites a specific emotion, curiosity, desire, a twinge of FOMO, a sense of recognition, and once that emotion is sparked, it creates an instant, often subconscious sense of connection with you. The reader feels like, hey, this person gets me or hey, this is relevant to me or hey, I want to know more about this.

And that connection is the bridge to action. The action might be replying to you to your DM or clicking a link or asking a question or simply paying closer attention to what you're about to say next. And without that initial emotional click and the resulting connection, the chances of them taking any action from your DMs are very, very slim.

So here's what that looks like in practice. The first DM reads. Join our webinar on digital marketing.

It's on Tuesday at 2 p.m. Here's the link to join. That's that DM is purely informational. There's no spark.

It doesn't make me feel anything and it's easy to ignore. Now, let's read the second one. Struggling to get leads on LinkedIn.

Next Tuesday, I'm revealing three simple tweaks that got one of my clients a 200 percent increase in inquiries. Want the link? That was different. It starts by touching on a potential pain point, the struggling to get leads.

Then it sparked desire with a 200 percent increase in inquiries and curiosity. Want the link? The emoji at the end just adds a friendly touch. As you can imagine, the second DM is much more likely to get that emotional click and a registration.

Now, here's the really challenging part, especially with microcopy. You don't have long time to make that emotional click happen. I call it the three second rule.

When someone sees your DM preview or the first line of your social media post or the headline of your ad, you have roughly three seconds, maybe even less, to make them feel something. If you don't evoke an emotion, curiosity, interest, surprise, relevance, something in those initial moments, the brain will likely filter you out and they're going to keep scrolling, their thumb will keep moving. It sounds brutal and it is, but that's the reality of attention, of the attention economy that we live in right now.

This is why you're opening hooks, your subject lines and the very first few words of your DMs are so incredibly critical. Here's an example of it. The first DM reads, Read our company newsletter.

Issue 28 is out now. What emotion does that evoke? Probably none, maybe boredom. And it's easy to ignore.

Now let's look at the second DM. Steal this email template. Open rates up to 50 percent.

Click now to download the newsletter. That's a big difference, isn't it? Steal this is a pattern interrupt. Open rates up to 50 percent.

That's a clear benefit and it taps into desire. In short, the second DM is much more likely to get opened and generate some kind of action, in this case, the download. Ultimately, one of the most powerful ways to create that emotional click and build an instant connection is to make the other person feel understood.

If your message accurately reflects a problem that they're currently facing, a desire that they have, a frustration they're experiencing or even a positive emotion they're feeling, they will likely feel a sense of rapport with you. It's like you've read their mind and you're speaking their language. When someone feels understood, their defenses come down.

They become more open, more receptive and more willing to engage in a conversation. That feeling of, wow, this person really gets me, is incredibly powerful for building trust and for building influence. Here's what I mean.

The first DM reads. Check out our new time management app. It's new and it will save you a lot of time.

That's a pretty generic DM. There's no emotion. There's no resonance.

The reader doesn't feel understood. The reader doesn't feel anything, really. The second the second DM reads, feeling like there are never enough hours in the day to run your business.

This brand new app can help you reclaim three or more hours every week. Now, that's more like it. We all feel like we never have enough time, like we never have enough hours in the day and getting three or more hours back every week.

Yeah, that's a pretty good deal. Sign up. OK, we've talked a lot about the why and the how of emotional resonance.

Now let's get super practical with a framework that you can use immediately to craft compelling micro messages. These are what I call the five core emotional hooks. These are simple starting points or angles that you can use to inject emotion right into your DMs, headlines and other short social media posts.

First up is desire. This hook taps into your audience's aspirations, their goals and what they want to achieve or gain. You're painting a picture of a better future, a desired outcome that your product or service or information can help them reach.

It's the fantasy island, it's heaven island. Here's how to use it. Start by asking what is the ultimate outcome my audience desires related to what I offer, then use that language that helps them visualize that outcome.

Some of the keywords or phrases that you can use is imagine if. What if you could? Picture yourself. Get some benefit that you've always wanted.

Finally, achieve blank. For example, if let's say you're sending a DM to a fitness coach. Or I'm sorry, a DM that a business coach might be sending out.

Imagine feeling energized and confident in your clothes in just six weeks. Our new Slim Life program is designed to help you get there. Or let's say.

You have a website design template that you're selling online. What if you could cut your website design time in half starting today? Or let's say you're trying to sell a training course. You could send out something that reads like picture this, a fully trained puppy that's loving, protective of your children and instantly obeys your every command.

That's the desire hook at play. It's a powerful hook because it connects with the hope and the envisions that your audience is already having. Next is my personal favorite for DMs.

Curiosity. This hook works by creating an information gap. You hint at something interesting, surprising or valuable, but you don't reveal it all up front.

This makes people lean in and want to know more. How you use it is think about something surprising, a surprising fact, a little known secret, common misconception or simply frame your value as a question. Here are some of the keywords or phrases that that you can use.

What if I told you? Or did you know or the secret to or you won't believe or here's something that most people don't realize about? Or, hey, I have a quick quick question for you about blank or have you ever wonder why? Blank, for example, let's let's say you're a marketing consultant and you're sending out a DM that says, hey, John, I noticed I noticed that your website. Did you know that I noticed on your website there's a little flaw. Did you know that one small change to your home page, home page headline could potentially increase your conversions by up to 20 percent? Or let's say you're you're creating a social media post.

You could type something out like the number one mistake most businesses make with their Instagram files and how to fix it is this. And then you provide the link or let's say you're just wanting to create a connection and you say. Hey, Steffi, you popped into my head today for a surprising reason.

Got a sack. That's going to get their attention, that's going to create curiosity in their brain, curiosity is like an open look in the brain, people, people are naturally driven to close those loops. Our third hook is fear and the very specific type of fear that's rampant today.

Fear of missing out or FOMO. This hook highlights what people might lose if they don't act or something that they might miss out on. It's important to note that.

You need to use this ethically and responsibly, genuine scarcity and real deadlines are fine to use, fabricated fear and pressure tactics backfire all the time and it damages your trust. So don't even try it. It's not worth it.

How you use it is if you have a genuine limited time offer, limited availability of your product or a warning about a common pitfall. Then you can use this hook and you're going to be using it with keywords or phrases like don't miss or limited time offer or only ten spots or only ten copies available. Do this before it's gone.

Avoid the mistake of blank. The last chance to blank. So let's say that you're trying to get someone to your audience to register for a webinar, you could send out a DM.
